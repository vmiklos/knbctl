= Web Interface for KNB
Miklos Vajna <vmiklos-at-vmiklos-dot-hu>

NOTE: I'm not really interested in working on this anymore, as it
fulfills my need. However, I can understand someone else might want to
try the same, so I put the code online to avoid double work.

== What's knbctl?

knbctl is a web interface for link:http://www.beer.one.pl/~esio/c/[knb],
an IRC bot to keep your nick on networks where there are no services.

== Why is it good?

If you host a knb for somebody with a dynamic ip and you don't want to
give shell access, then just install knbctl and the user will be able to
self-administrate himself/herself.

== How does it work?

First you need to edit the `knbctl.config` file. 'username' and
'password' is used for the web interface, try to login with any password
to get the hash. The nick is the nick of the bot when it does not keep
your nick. The 'knbdir' directive specifies the directory where the
`<nick>.xml` and the `knb` executable can be found.

When the user edits the details on the web and presses the submit button
the `<nick>.uf` and `<nick>.conf` files are regenerated from the
`<nick>.xml` file and the bot is restarted.

Once again:

- You need to edit knbctl.config!
- You need to have knbctl.config in the same dir as knbctl.py is and you
  need to have the `<nick>.xml` file where the `knb` execurable can be
  found.

Enjoy!
